To create an environment from Milena's venv project and install packages use the environment.yml file.

You will need to install conda on your machine.
Download the miniconda installer at https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/.
Run the installer.
Restart your terminal.
Check if you have it well installed by running: 
`conda --version`

Finally to create the project's environment please run the following line in you terminal:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`
